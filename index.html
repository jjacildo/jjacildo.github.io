					My name is Jonathan Paul Jacildo</br>
					I am an aspiring software engineer looking for an entry-level/junior software engineer job. I am curious and diligent when it comes to learning new technology. I believe in today's community technology has been an essential aspect of our lives, it is everywhere from the small things that we do, up to the big industries that harness the potential of innovative technology.
					</br>
					I'm currently learning and working on personal projects involving Java Frameworks: Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Node.js, and NoSql using Mongo.DB

					<b>Research Project 1, Java II</b></br>
					Given an image file we were tasked to make two more image files with one of the images being flipped on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. My contribution to the project was figuring
					out the necessary code to flip the images. You can view my part of the code in the image.java file by downloading the code below.</br>
