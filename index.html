					My name is Jonathan Paul Jacildo
					I'm a Computer Engineering Student at Northeastern Illinois University. My concentration of study is Information Technology and Networking. I've obtained my Associates in Science from Wilbur Wright College. I've intermediate skills in coding languages like Java, C#, HTML, and CSS.
					My favorite hobby is playing soccer. My favorite soccer club is Atl√©tico Madrid. I always believe in Steve Jobs because according to him "The ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do." He is a great innovator and this quote inspires people especially myself to be one someday.

					<b>Research Project 1, Java II</b></br>
					Given an image file we were tasked to make two more image files with one of the images being flipped on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. My contribution to the project was figuring
					out the necessary code to flip the images. You can view my part of the code in the image.java file by downloading the code below.</br>
